# sub_bruteforcer

A simple ruby script for bruteforcing subdomains.
This script automatically grabs a wordlist from the `SecLists` repo and then it checks for all the available subdomains.

## Thanks to SecLists and its creators

**Thanks to SecLists for such an awesome wordlist, I've used https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/master/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1mil-110000.txt in the script.**

## Usage

``` 
$ ruby sub_bruteforcer.rb <example.com>
```
*Without angle brackets*
